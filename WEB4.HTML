      East Africa is considered the cradle of humankind, and Kenya has a number
      of archeological sites. Prehistoric sites are found throughout Kenya with
      some of the best known being: Hyrax Hill - prehistoric site near Nakuru,
      it is considered one of the country's most important neolithic excavation
      sites. Hyrax Hill dates from 1500 B.C. and was discovered by Louis and
      Mary Leakey in 1926. A fortress and and several tombs were found there.

      Koobi Fora - a source of hominin fossils shedding light on the evolution
      of man over the previous 4.2 million years, but far exceeding the number
      of humanoid fossils are the non-humanoid fossils giving a detailed look at
      the fauna and flora as far back as the Miocene era Pate Island.

      Kenyan North Coast - human activity dating back from the 7th century has
      been found in this ancient port town. Chinese porcelain artefacts prove
      that the Chinese were trading in Africa centuries ago.

      Kariandusi near Lake Elementaita - site of the hand-axe man was discovered
      in 1928. A rise in the Lake level drove prehistoric men from their
      lake-side home and buried all the tools and weapons which were left behind
      Olorgesailie, Eastern Rift Valley about 70 Km south of Nairobi - this site
      is significant for geology, paleontology as well as archeology. Here
      volcano ash helped to preserve many animal fossils as well as some now
      extinct animals. There has also been found an abundance of hand axes. The
      first human fossil was unearthed here; the skull of Homo erectus. There
      are many other sites in Kenya that indicate different eras in earth's
      history and the country is truly an archaeologists dream.

      In Nairobi, Kenya there is the National Museum which is a must see for
      lovers of history as it has numerous interesting pieces to see.
