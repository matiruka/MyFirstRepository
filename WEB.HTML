    <p>
      Kenya is well known as a major African tourist hub. From the dry, grassy
      savannah to its rainforests, it boasts numerous different wild
      animals. Kenya is among few countries in the world that are home to the
      famous "big five" animals which include the Elephant, Rhino, Lion, Buffalo
      and Leopard. Kenya also has several archeological sites which attract
      thousands of history lovers from all over the world. The country is also
      along the equator which ensures that it has a hot, tropical climate
      throughout most of the year, this coupled with the fact that it has a long
      shoreline makes it a perfect attraction for people who love to tour
      beaches.

      Nakuru, Hells Gate, Tsavo East and West National Park to mention but a
      few. The countryâ€™s notable tourist attraction is the annual Wildebeest

      and harmony throughout the year. It also consists of more than 40 tribes
