      Mount Kenya is well known especially for having snow on its peak despite
      being so close to the equator. Climbing to 5,199 meters, Mount Kenya is
      the second tallest mountain in Africa. The scenery surrounding this
      designated World Heritage Site is breath-taking. It is pristine wilderness
      with lakes, tarns, glaciers, dense forest, mineral springs and a selection
      of rare and endangered species of animals, high altitude adapted plains
      game and unique montane and alpine vegetation. Visitors can enjoy mountain
      climbing, camping and caving with the mountain’s rugged glacier-clad peaks
      providing the perfect backdrop.

      To the south of Kenya near its border with Tanzania is the beautiful
      Amboseli National Park. Nicknamed "Home of the African Elephant” Crowned
      by Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest peak, the Amboseli National Parks
      is one of Kenya's most popular parks. The name "Amboseli" comes from a
      Maasai word meaning "salty dust". Nature lovers can explore five different
      habitats here ranging from the dried-up bed of Lake Amboseli, wetlands
      with sulphur springs, the savannah and woodlands.
