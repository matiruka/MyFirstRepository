      Although the official languages are Swahili and English, Kenya is a
      multilingual country. There are 62 languages spoken throughout which
      mainly consist of tribal African languages as well as a minority of
      Middle-Eastern and Asian languages spoken by descendants of foreign
      settlers (i.e. Arabic, Hindi, etc).

      Kenya is not a homogeneous country ethnicity wise. The make-up of Kenyans
      is primarily that of 13 ethnic groups with an additional 27 smaller
      groups. The majority of Kenyans belong to ‘Bantu’ tribes such as the
      Kikuyu, Luhya and Kamba. There are also the ‘Nilotic’ tribes such as the
      Luo, Kalenjin, Maasai and Turkana. The ‘Hamitic’ people include the
      Turkana, Rendille and Samburu. Around 13% of the population are of
      non-African descent, i.e. Indian, Arab and European.

      There is no singular dish that represents all of Kenya's wide cuisine.
      Different communities have their own native foods. Staples are maize and
      other cereals depending on the region, including millet and sorghum eaten
      with various meats and vegetables. The foods that are universally eaten in
      Kenya are ugali, sukuma wiki, and nyama choma. Kenya's coastal cuisine is
      unique and highly regarded throughout the country.
