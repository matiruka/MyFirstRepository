    <p>
      Kenya is among the few countries in the world with the big five animals,
      namely; Elephant, Rhino, Lion, Buffalo, Leopard. Its capital is also the
      only capital city in the world to have a game park and is rightly
      nicknamed the green city under the sun. Kenya has numerous game parks,
      game reserves and sanctuaries across it which are host to a wide variety
      of wild animals.

      Maasai Mara is it's most famous one with the annual wildebeest migration
      which is at it's peak in the July, August months. One of the most
      sought-after experiences for wildlife and nature enthusiasts, the Great
      Migration is the ever-moving circular migration of over a million animals
      across the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem. The constant movement of columns of
      wildebeest, joined by a host of companions, follow an age-old route in
      search of grazing and water. After calving in the southern part of
      Tanzania's Serengeti near the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, the animals
      journey through the Serengeti up and around in a clockwise direction
      towards the Masai Mara in Kenya, before returning once again near the end
      of the year. Along the way, high drama is always present, as thousands of
      animals are taken by predators and thousands more are born, replenishing
      the numbers and sustaining the circle of life.
